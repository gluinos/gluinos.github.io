## What is a gluino, anyways?

Gluinos are one of many particles predicted by the theory of [Supersymmetry](https://home.cern/science/physics/supersymmetry), which predicts a parter to every currently-known particle, which are all included in the experimentally-proven, yet fundamentally flawed, Standard Model of particle physics (all named using the "particle-ino" convention). Specifically, however, gluinos are the theoretical partners to the gluon, a Standard Model particle responsible for communicating the Strong Force between quarks. In Layman's terms, it is the "glue" (hence the name) that holds particles like the proton and neutron together.

## Now, who are the Gluinos?

The Gluinos organization was created for SB Hacks V where we debued with ChompChapp, a machine-learning-driven service for providing local restaurant recommendations. ChompChapp based its opinion on the user's subconscious profile, which was probed by flashing a list of food-related words to the user, where they were encouraged the press the spacebar whenever a word felt "right." In summary, then, we are hackers committed to making unique applications that may, one day, become something great. Current and past members of the gluinos are listed here:
